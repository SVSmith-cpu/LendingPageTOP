Completing the task of creating a Landing Page.

Requirements for the task:
1. https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
2. https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/02f3babb44a3d30dccdf6ca30283ac64ec02abbd/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png

While completing the task, I couldn't figure out how to organize the page's autoscaling for different monitor resolutions, so I set the main field width to a fixed 1000px and used this parameter as a starting point when configuring other objects.
